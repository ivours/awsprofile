# awsprofile
Simple tool to easily switch between aws profiles.

## Usage

Just execute `. awscredentials.sh`. It will search for all your credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` file and list the options labeled by number. Select the corresponding number to the credentials you want to use and then you'll be ready to execute aws cli commands with the selected profile.
